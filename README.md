# AlgaeClassifier
This is the deep learning part of HAB prediction model.
Clean waterâ€™s aim is to create an integrated water quality monitoring system about water quality water quality starting at lake Erie that
provides an alert system about harmful algea blooms.
Phase 1 is a data analysis model of Algae Blooms.
Using the concept of transer learning we trained our model on VGG16 architecture on 97 images and tested it on 29 images of lakes that were affected and unaffected by algae blooms.
We attained a percent accuracy of 93.1 on test images.
